Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) – Simulation & Analysis

This project implements the Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) strategy using Python.
It includes Monte Carlo simulations, dynamic allocation logic, GBM-based price modeling, and a full comparison
between a baseline (unprotected) portfolio and a CPPI-protected portfolio.

The goal is to understand how CPPI provides downside protection while still participating in upside market moves.
